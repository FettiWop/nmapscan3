# nmapscan3


So this is bascially just a python script to enable easier nmap scanning, using flags that i normally use.

You can edit the script as you choose, and it runs the first nmap command as it's set already, then once complete, grabs the ports found to be in the "OPEN" state, and will run a secondary scan on those ports. 

Use as you wish, just credit me if you utilize it and make changes.

I envision this as an ever evolving script, so please if you have suggestions or something that you see could be an improvement SEND IT!

Thanks - Fetti.Wop
